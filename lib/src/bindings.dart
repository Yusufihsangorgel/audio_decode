// decoders. The native library is produced by hook/build.dart, which registers
// it under the asset id of this file (src/bindings.dart), so every @Native
// symbol below resolves to it.

// Each decode function takes the encoded bytes and their length, writes the
// channel count, sample rate and per-channel sample count through int
// out-parameters, and stores a freshly allocated buffer of interleaved int16
// samples through the `short**` out-parameter. It returns 0 on success and a
// non-zero value on failure, in which case no buffer is allocated.
